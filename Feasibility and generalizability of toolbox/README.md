XX_ LSM. Png: landslide susceptibility map generated by XX model



In XX_ parameter_ result_ png, The size of the circle representatives the AUC value The larger the circle, the higher the AUC value and the better the accuracy of the model. The circular color represents the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. If it exceeds 0.5, it is represented by 0.5.
